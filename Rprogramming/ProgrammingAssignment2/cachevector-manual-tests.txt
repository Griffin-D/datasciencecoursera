Vector Tests:

a <- makeVector(c(1,2,3,4))
a$get()
[1] 1 2 3 4 

a$getmean()
NULL

cachemean(a)
[1] 2.5

 a$getmean()  # this is only to show you that the mean has been stored and does not affect anything
[1] 2.5

 cachemean(a)
getting cached data
[1] 2.5

 a$set(c(10,20,30,40))

 a$getmean()
NULL

cachemean(a)
[1] 25

cachemean(a)
getting cached data
[1] 25

 a$get()
[1] 10 20 30 40

a$setmean(0) 
 do NOT call setmean() directly despite it being accessible for the reason you will see next. It 
appears to go into an endless loop. esc to get out.

a$getmean()
[1] 0      # obviously non-sense since... hhmmm. I got 25.Probably because I hit escape.

a$get()
[1] 10 20 30 40

cachemean(a)
[1] 0    # as you can see the call to setmean() effectively corrupted the functioning of the code

 a <- makeVector(c(5, 25, 125, 625))

 a$get()
[1] 5 25 125 625

 cachemean(a)
[1] 195

 cachemean(a)
getting cached data
[1] 195
